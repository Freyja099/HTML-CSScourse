<!-- ! Session 6 : HTML structure-->
<!-- * we going to learn now the right HTML structure -->
 <!-- * we will use the HTML doctype -->
  
<!-- * Every HTML file is going to start with : <!DOCTYPE html> -->
 <!-- <!DOCTYPE html> --> 

<!-- * 
 * This tells a browser to use a modern version of html 
 * if we don't have this we going to miss a lot of features 
 *-->

 <!-- *
  * The next part of these structure is to create an HTML element
  *  <html> ....  </html>
  * this says there's a webpage inside this element
  * inside this we going to create the head element
  !<html> 
    * <head> .... </head>
    * <body> .... </body>
  !</html> 
  *-->
<!-- * This is the proper structure of all of our HTML files 
* we can  see that we have an element inside another element this is called
* nesting 
* every file has one and only one HTML element <html> = a web page
* and this element represents the entire webpage , the html element is 
* designed for nesting, it's designed to contain one head element and one
* body element, and then everything on our webpage is supposed to go either inside 
* the head or the body element 
* the body element contains all elements that are visible
* the head element is used to contain meta information about the webpage
* ( the element that are not visible on our webpage ) for e.g : <title>...</title>
* it will change the text in the tab
* the second feature for following the structure is the ability to automatically
* reload our webpage whenever we change our code
* -->
<!-- * We'll try to write the first part of button.html file in the correct structure -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    <head>
        <title> Button </title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/HTML_stucture.CSS">
    </head>


    <body>

        <button class="SUBSCRIBE-button">
            SUBSCRIBE
       </button>
      
       <button class="JOIN-button" > 
           JOIN 
       </button>
       
       <button class="Twitter-button"> 
           Twitter
       </button>

    </body>

</html>
<!--* the style doesn't really show on the page that's why we put it inside the head element -->
<!-- !
 ! we can see that we can get confused if we use both html and css at the same file that's why 
 ! we going to start writing css on another file that ends with .CSS
 ! and then link it to our html file with the <link> tag it doesn't required to be closed
 ! elements like these are called "void elements" = don't need a closing tag
 ! this link element takes two attributes the first one is called "rel" which stands for relation
 ! the second one is called "href" which stands for hypertext reference
 ! in our case we are linking our CSS file to our HTML file
 ! the "rel" attribute is used to specify the relationship between the current document and the linked document
 ! the "href" attribute is used to provide the URL of the linked document
 !-->
<!-- * 
 * To link a file in the same folder we can just use the name of the file but if it was in a different 
 * folder we have to write first the folder's name then slash /then the file's name 
 * This is called filepaths and this is basically how we locate different files within our HTML code
 * -->

 <!-- *
  * Another feature for using the structure is the ability to add a new fonts into our website
  * websites have a set of fonts by default that we can use for example : Arial, Times New Roman, so in addition to
  * the default fonts we can use other fonts as well we can upload from the internet ( google fonts )
  * there we can find the link we can copy and use it in the head element and then write in the CSS code the new font
  * we wanted and wasn't available
  * -->
