<!-- * Session 12 : Flexbox -->

<!-- * 
 * Flexbox is another way to create layout, it is similar to CSS grid but it's more flexible 
 * we use a container here too, the display property is set as flex ( display : flex ;) and 
 * by using flex-direction : row ; this will make our elements align horizontally 
 * the divs inside the container don't behave like block elements anymore they take as much 
 * space they need like an inline-block element  
 * it's another way to creating horizontal layouts while maintaining alignement
 * To take the rest of space we have like fr here we use the property called flex
 * flex : 1 ; 1 is equivalent to 1fr in grid (2 is 2fr)
 * for the differences : the layout is more rigid for grid and flexbox has flexible layout 
 * the value of flex is written in each div not like grid we wrote it all in grid-template-columns 
 * and the divs follows the order of values

 <!-- *
  * When we want a flexible layout depending on our content it's better to use flexbox
  * - To change the placement of our divs we use the justify-content property
  * justify-content: start ; to begin from the left side
  * "end "; they will be aligned to the right side
  * or "center"
  * or "space-between" ; to spreads out our elements evenly across the horizontal space and 
  * to make sure that there's equal amount of space between each element
  
  * - align-items is a property to determine how elements are aligned vertically, the default value 
  * is "stretch" which makes the elements stretching to fill up the vertical space 
  * or use "start" they'll take up as much vertical space as they need to from the top of the container
  * or " end " they'll take up as much vertical space as they need to starting from the bottom of the container
  * or "center"
  
  * To limit a width of a flexbox we use max-width
