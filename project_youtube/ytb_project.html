 *To upload images on website or to save them or use their URL link
 *we can use dev tools and open the image on a new tab then click on ctrl+s 
 *to save it on our folder that contains our code

 <!-- * 
  * To create an image element we write <img> this is also a void element
  * <img src=""> src is the attribut , it tells the computer which image to 
  * display on the website; the source attribut work as the link attribut we 
  * already used for the CSS file
  *-->

  <!-- *
   * the same properties we used to work with in CSS can be applied to images
   * like width, height, margin, padding, border, etc.
   *-->

<!-- *
 * In addition to all the CSS properties we've learnt the image element has its own 
 * properties that are specific to an image such as :
 * - max-width : to set the maximum width of the image
 * - max-height : to set the maximum height of the image
 * - object-fit : to fit the image inside the div while keeping its aspect ratio
 * - fill : to fill the div completely with the image
 * - contain : to fill the div completely with the image but to preserve its aspect ratio
 * - cover : to fill the div completely with the image but to stretch it to fit the div 
 * we can write object-fit: cover ; to keep the shade of the picture if we want a specific
 * height // there's also something called : object-position:(e.g left or right) ; this is 
 * used in case the image doesn't fit the area we want 
 * also if we can use border for the image we want : border-width:3px;  border-style:solid;
 * border-color:red; in this case we can move the object-position to the top or the bottom 
 *

 <!-- *
 * The HTML for creating a text box is <input> it's also a void element that we use in the 
 * body, the input elementhas several attributes that we can give it one of them is called 
 * the type such as : text, checkbox,... 
 *-->

 <!-- *
  * Another thing we find in site is something like a label for user telling them what to put 
  * or what to type and once you start writing it disapear (e.g : search ) the name for that is
  * a placeholder
